<section id="key">
  <h2> Key features </h2>

  <p>
  Key features of the Dart language include:
  </p>


  <h3>Classes</h3>
  <p>
  Classes and interfaces provide a well understood mechanism
  for efficiently defining APIs.
  These constructs enable encapsulation and reuse of methods and data.
  </p>

  <h3>Optional types</h3>
  <p>
  Dart programmers can optionally add static types to their code.
  Depending on programmer preference and stage of application development,
  the code can migrate from a simple, untyped experimental prototype
  to a complex, modular application with typing.
  Because types state programmer intent,
  less documentation is required to explain what is happening in the code,
  and type-checking tools can be used for debugging.
  </p>

  <h3>Libraries</h3>
  <p>
  Developers can create and use libraries
  that are guaranteed not to change during runtime.
  Independently developed pieces of code can therefore
  rely on shared libraries.
  </p>

  <h3>Tooling</h3>
  <p>
  Dart will include a rich set of
  execution environments, libraries, and development tools
  built to support the language.
  These tools will enable productive and dynamic development,
  including edit-and-continue debugging and beyond&mdash;up
  to a style where you program an application outline, run it,
  and fill in the blanks as you run.
  </p>
</section>


<section id="goals">
  <h2> Design goals </h2>

  <p>
  The Dart programming language is presented here in its early stages.
  The following design goals will guide
  the continued evolution and refinement of this open source project:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Create a <b>structured yet flexible</b>
      programming language for the web.</li>
    <li>Make Dart feel <b>familiar and natural</b> to programmers
      and thus easy to learn.</li>
    <li>Ensure that all Dart language constructs allow
      <b>high performance</b> and
      <b>fast application startup</b>.</li>
    <li>Make Dart appropriate for the
      <b>full range of devices on the web</b>&mdash;including
      phones, tablets, laptops, and servers.</li>
    <li>Provide tools that make Dart run fast
      <b>across all major modern browsers</b>. </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  These design goals address the following problems
  currently facing web developers:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Small scripts often evolve into
      large web applications with no apparent structure&mdash;they&rsquo;re
      hard to debug and difficult to maintain.
      In addition, these monolithic apps can&rsquo;t be split up
      so that different teams can work on them independently.
      It&rsquo;s difficult to be productive
      when a web application gets large.</li>
    <li>Scripting languages are popular
      because their lightweight nature makes it easy to write code quickly.
      Generally, the contracts with other parts of an application
      are conveyed in comments rather than in the language structure itself.
      As a result, it&rsquo;s difficult for someone other than the author
      to read and maintain a particular piece of code.</li>
    <li>With existing languages,
      the developer is forced to make a choice between
      static and dynamic languages.
      Traditional static languages require heavyweight toolchains
      and a coding style that can feel inflexible and overly constrained.</li>
    <li>Developers have not been able to create homogeneous systems
      that encompass both client and server,
      except for a few cases such as Node.js and Google Web Toolkit (GWT).
      </li>
    <li>Different languages and formats entail context switches
      that are cumbersome and add complexity to the coding process.</li>
  </ul>

<section id="code">
<h2>Show me the code</h2>

<p>
Here are several code snippets
to give you a feel for what Dart code looks like.
</p>

<section id="classes">
<h3>Classes and interfaces</h3>

<p>
Dart&rsquo;s interfaces and classes provide you with
a set of reusable and extensible building blocks.
An <em>interface</em> defines a basic set of methods and constants,
sometimes by inheriting from other interfaces.
A <em>class</em> can implement multiple interfaces,
but it only inherits from a single superclass.
</p>

<p>
The following example defines an interface,
along with a class and subclass that implement it:
</p>

{% highlight dart %}
interface Shape {
  num perimeter();
}

class Rectangle implements Shape {
  final num height, width; 
  Rectangle(num this.height, num this.width);  // Compact constructor syntax.
  num perimeter() => 2*height + 2*width;       // Short function syntax.
}

class Square extends Rectangle {
  Square(num size) : super(size, size);
}
{% endhighlight %}

</section> <!-- classes -->


<section id="optional-types">
<h3>Optional types</h3>

<p>
Dart provides, at the programmer&rsquo;s option,
a mixture of static and dynamic checking.
When experimenting,
the programmer can write untyped code for simple prototyping.
As the application becomes larger and more stable,
types can be added to aid debugging and impose structure where desired.
</p>

<p>
For example, here is a sample of untyped code in Dart
that creates a new Point class that has parameters
<code>x</code> and <code>y</code>
and two methods:
<code>scale()</code> and <code>distance()</code>.
</p>

{% highlight dart %}
import 'dart:math';

class Point {
  var x, y;
  Point(this.x, this.y);
  scale(factor) => new Point(x*factor, y*factor);
  distance() => sqrt(x*x + y*y);
}

main() {
  var a = new Point(2,3).scale(10);
  print(a.distance());
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
Here is what this code looks like with types added
that ensure that
<code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>factor</code>
are of type <code>num</code>,
and that a <code>Point</code> contains two values
of type <code>num</code>:
</p>

{% highlight dart %}
import 'dart:math';

class Point {
  num x, y;
  Point(num this.x, num this.y);
  Point scale(num factor) => new Point(x*factor, y*factor);
  num distance() => sqrt(x*x + y*y);
}

void main() {
  Point a = new Point(2,3).scale(10);
  print(a.distance());
}
{% endhighlight %}

<section id="howtouse">
<h2>How can I use Dart?</h2>

<p>
You can run Dart code in several ways:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
    Compile Dart code to JavaScript that can run in any modern browser:<br />
    Chrome, Safari 5+, and Firefox 4+ (more browser support coming shortly)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
    Execute Dart code directly in a VM on your computer
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
    With a <a href="#mimetype">new MIME type</a>,
    use Dart in a browser
    without first compiling to JavaScript
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<section id="editor">
<h3>Dart Editor</h3>

<p>
Dart Editor is a tool for
creating, modifying, and launching Dart web apps.
With one click, you can compile a Dart web app to JavaScript
and launch the app in a browser.
Taking advantage of Dart&rsquo;s structured nature,
Dart Editor supports method name completion and refactoring.
</p>

<p>
For information about downloading and using Dart Editor, see the
<a href="/docs/editor/getting-started/">Dart Editor tutorial</a>.
</p>
</section>

<section id="mimetype">
<h3>New MIME type</h3>

<p>
You will be able to link to a Dart program directly from an HTML page.
Here is the proposed new MIME type,
&ldquo;application/dart&rdquo;:
</p>

{% highlight html %}
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>
  <head>
    <title>Simple Dart Web App</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Simple Dart Web App</h1>
    <h2 id="status">dart is starting up...</h2>
    <script type="application/dart" src="SimpleDartWebApp.dart"></script>
    <script src="http://dart.googlecode.com/svn/branches/bleeding_edge/dart/client/dart.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
The dart.js file above will swap out the <code>application/dart</code>
tag with a <code>text/javascript</code> tag if the browser does not
have an embedded Dart virtual machine.
</p>

<p>
The following is the Dart code for the page above:
</p>

{% highlight dart %}
import 'dart:html';

class SimpleDartWebApp {
  void run() {
    write("Hello World!");
  }

  void write(String message) {
    // the HTML library defines a global "document" variable
    document.query('#status').innerHTML = message;
  }
}

void main() {
  new SimpleDartWebApp().run();
}
{% endhighlight %}
</section> <!-- howtouse -->
</section> <!-- mimetype -->


<section id="tools">
<h2>Tools</h2>

<p>
The Dart language is accompanied by a set of tools
to aid rapid prototyping, coding, and debugging
for the entire development cycle.
Offerings include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Dart Editor</li>
  <li>The dart2js compiler</li>
  <li>The Dart VM</li>
  <li>Dartium: Chromium with an embedded Dart VM</li>
</ul>

<p>
On the client side, you can deploy Dart apps in two ways.
For browsers without an embedded Dart VM,
you can compile the Dart code to JavaScript,
using the dart2js compiler. This compiler generates ECMAScript5-compatible
JavaScript from the Dart code. Dart code can run
directly in browsers that have a Dart VM,
including Dartium (a special build of Chromium)
and eventually Chrome.
</p>

<p>
On the server side, the Dart code runs directly on the command line,
for fast iteration and for cloud-based tasks.
</p>
